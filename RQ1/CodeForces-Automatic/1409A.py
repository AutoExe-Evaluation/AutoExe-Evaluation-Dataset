    # Input Format:
    # The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4) â€” the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.The only line of the test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b \le 10^9).

    # Program Description:
    # You are given two integers a and b.In one move, you can choose some integer k from 1 to 10 and add it to a or subtract it from a. In other words, you choose an integer k \in [1; 10] and perform a := a + k or a := a - k. You may use different values of k in different moves.Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain b from a.You have to answer t independent test cases.
    # Output Format:
    # For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of moves required to obtain b from a.
